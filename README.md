# Pose-Estimation-Android-app-using-Deep-Learning
A basic Deep Learning application for Android built using Tensorflow Lite framework.

This repository includes an Android application which estimates body pose. It uses Tensorflow Lite framework to run Deep Learning CNN network to detect human body points.

**Note: This repository only provides the baseline for mobile inference. There is a separate repo for model training and its archicture.**


This also has GPU inplementation for faster inference speed on all the smartphones with GPU.
Uncomment the code to enable the use of GPU for this app.

**Training script for the model used in this application will be uploded soon.**
